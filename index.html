    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my personal research page. I specialize in original inventions, deep mathematical logic, and symbolic systems for AI, robotics, and scientific computing. My mission is to build foundational systems that transform future technologies.</p>
  </section>

<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am an independent researcher and systems technologist, with a foundational academic background in mathematics (B.Sc.) and over a decade of applied experience as a Senior Java Developer. My work bridges formal abstraction with scalable system design, specialising in symbolic computing frameworks, deterministic algorithmic logic, and foundational models for machine reasoning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rooted in a deep curiosity for the mathematical nature of intelligence, I have spent several years conducting independent research in symbolic AI, entropy-aware computation, and structure-preserving data representations. In 2025, this ongoing pursuit culminated in a focused mission to document and secure a portfolio of over 50 original computational systems through patent filings. These inventions span graph-colouring optimisation, quantum probability encoding, topological signal filtration, recursive compression techniques, symbolic tensor design, and entropy-driven robotic navigation. Each system is conceived not merely as a theoretical construct, but as a deployable component for next-generation technologies in space exploration, scientific computing, and autonomous systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    My methodological approach is grounded in mathematical clarity and first-principle reasoning â€” favouring closed-form formulations, zero-loss symbolic transformations, and scalable architectures. The aim is not simply to compute faster, but to enable systems to think symbolically, reason precisely, and act with measurable intelligence. I strive to unify theoretical rigour with real-world adaptability.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I continue developing these frameworks, I seek collaborative environments where fundamental ideas can grow into systems that serve humanity. Whether in academic research groups, innovation labs, or organisations such as Google Research, DeepMind, or international space agencies, I am open to opportunities that align with ethical inquiry, scientific contribution, and technological purpose. My work is guided not by titles or trends, but by a deep respect for the timeless pursuit of knowledge â€” and a commitment to building systems that matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do not approach invention as conquest, but as conversation â€” a quiet dialogue between the known and the possible. Each formula I derive, each system I build, is an offering: not to claim mastery, but to honour the silent architecture of the universe. I see myself not as a discoverer of greatness, but as a careful observer â€” someone placing one stone at a time along a much older path. To invent, for me, is an act of reverence: a way to serve knowledge, not possess it. I believe that true progress begins where precision meets humility, where thought becomes service, and where science listens deeply to the symmetry already written into nature. This, for me, is both vocation and devotion.
